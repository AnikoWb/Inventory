# Inventory
This is another project I created during my SE studies at HyperionDev.

This program is an inventory database and system for warehouses built in Python with Object Oriented Programming. The program reads data from a text file and updates the text file if there is any change in the inventory. It provides the following menu options for users (who are Store Managers, Regional Directors): list all products with price, quantity, location, and item code; search for an item by the item code, search for the item with the lowest quantity and restock this product, search for the item with the highest quantity which is on sale, add a new product to the inventory. The products are stored in a list as objects with all their details, the OOP approach makes it easy to work with this program.
